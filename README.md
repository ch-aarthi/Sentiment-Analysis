# Sentiment-Analysis
The primary goal is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify the sentiment of text data, providing valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends
Sentiment analysis is widely used in business intelligence, marketing, brand monitoring, and customer service to understand how people feel about products, services, or topics.

üóÇÔ∏è **Dataset**

The dataset consists of labeled text samples where each entry contains:

Text: The sentence, review, or social media post.

Sentiment Label: Positive, Negative, or Neutral (depending on dataset).

Possible datasets include:

Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset

IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset

Custom scraped data

‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow**

Data Preprocessing

Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, special characters)

Tokenization

Lemmatization/Stemming

Handling imbalanced classes

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Word frequency analysis

Word clouds for each sentiment class

Sentiment distribution visualization

Model Development
Implemented and compared multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

(Optional) Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT, etc.)

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

üìä **Results**

Traditional ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) perform well for baseline.

Advanced models (SVM, Random Forest) improve accuracy.

Deep learning (LSTM, Transformers like BERT) can further boost performance on large datasets.
